Finish setting up the DAC parameters properly
Write a digital filter to filter the ramp ...?
Remove timer.c/h and led modules
Remove GDB targets and stuff like that in Makefile


Done

FIX BUILD, remove all the USB crap, fix lseek, read etc problem
(Maybe look at Blinky example for this?)
 * Why does adc_dac need syscalls.c, but blinky doesn't?!?
 * Tried copying to Blinky tree (so that it would use the STM FW directory from there... still didn't work
 * PROBLEM was the asserts in the LED driver - don't do this.  =)
